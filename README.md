# polymake_LatticeNormalForm
A polymake extension for the computation of a normal form of a lattice polytope

=====================

This is an extension to the polymake system (http://polymake.org) for the computation of lattice normal forms of lattice polytopes and for checking lattice isomorphism of lattice polytopes (based on the algorithm of Kreuzer and Skarke (see http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0204356) with improvements by Grinis and Kasprzyk (http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.6641) 

It supersedes the extension lattice_normal_form, which won't work anymore with recent versions of polymake. 

To import this extension into polymake please download it and do 

import_extension("\<path_to_this_extension\>");

at the polymake prompt.
